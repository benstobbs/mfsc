# MFSC - My First Soft Core

## Overview
MFSC is a Visual Studio Code IDE extension which enables very easy soft-core CPU based SoC design for FPGAs. In just a few clicks, users can run C code on a CPU on their FPGA development board, and interact with GPIO similarly to an Arduino.

MFSC also enables users to easily extend the SoC by adding their own custom Verilog hardware modules. These can be easily connected directly to the board's GPIO pins, and interacted with from software.

## About
MFSC was developed as a Final Year Electrical and Electronic Engineering Project at Imperial College London. 

## Current Status
MFSC currently only supports the OrangeCrab Lattice ECP5 development board.
